Mmmmmmmmmmmm thank you @username.
If you stop to think about it, youâ€™ll have to admit, @username, that all the stories in the world consist essentially of twenty-six letters.
Thank you @username, never give up, and good luck will find you.
There are people we meet in life, that make everything seem magical. Cherish them @username.
@username made many wishes, and had many amazing adventures - until he came back to the real world. But that's... another story.
Remember @username, at any given moment you have the power to say: This is not how the story is going to end.
Having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a quest, @username.
Don't let the sadness of the swamps get to you. You have to try. You have to care. You are my friend, @username. I love you.
What you don't wish for will always be beyond your reach, @username.
In the beginning it is always dark, @username.
